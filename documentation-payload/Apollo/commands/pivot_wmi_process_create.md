## Detailed Summary
The `pivot_wmi_process_create` uses SMB and WMI for remote file copy and process execution to perform lateral movement. The payload selected is written to the target host with a random GUID filename over SMB using the `System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes` method. Execution of the payload is then achieved through the use of the `Win32_process` method of the `System.Management` class.
