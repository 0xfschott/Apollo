## Detailed Summary
The `psinject` command uses process injection into a remote process to execute PowerShell commands in the context of the target process. This method uses the agentâ€™s current injection technique which can be viewed with [`get_current_injection_technique`](/agents/apollo/commands/get_current_injection_technique/).
