## Detailed Usage
The `unload_assembly` command removes the specified assembly from the agent's cache. This command is only valid for assembly files that have been loaded with the [`register_assembly`](/agents/apollo/commands/register_assembly/) command. Apollo tracks these files using filename whent he assembly was loaded, which means this name must match when unloading so that it can correctly be found by the agent.
